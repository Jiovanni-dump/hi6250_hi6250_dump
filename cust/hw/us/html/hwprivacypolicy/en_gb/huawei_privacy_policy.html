If you do not accept this Policy, please  do not provide information to Huawei; access, use or browse the Sites, Products  or Services; or participate in any Activities. </p>
  <p><strong>2. Types of Information We Collect </strong></p>
  <p>We collect certain personally identifiable  information about you, which includes, without limitation, information that can  be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a  single person, or to identify an individual. This includes first and last name, email  addresses, delivery and billing addresses, telephone numbers, fax numbers, usernames and passwords, dates of birth, transaction history, refund history, the  precise or approximate geo-location of your Product, refund and repair  information relating to your Product, comments or feedback regarding the Sites,  Products or Services, and other non-public information. We use this information  for various purposes, for example to process your order, to send you relevant  marketing messages and to invite you to our Activities, and in other ways that  are further detailed below. <br />
    As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically. This includes, without limitation, information that does not personally identify you as the individual to whom the information relates,  such as information that is aggregated by Huawei or a third party, or  information that is not linked to contact information or other personally  identifiable information about you. Automatically collected information may include information about your use of the Sites, Products and Services, such as your IP address(es), usage  statistics, performance statistics, browsing and navigational history when  visiting the Sites and, general geographic location such as the city from which  your computer or device is connecting to the Internet, web pages requested and  visited, timestamps, sites you visit prior to and after visiting the Sites,  type of operating system you use on your computer (e.g., Microsoft Windows or  Mac OS) or device (e.g., iOS or Android) to access the Sites, the type of  browser you use (e.g., Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari), the domain  name of your internet service provider, and information regarding your Internet  location if and when you see Huawei ads and whether you click on such ad. This information is collected to analyse trends in the aggregate and to administer the Sites.<br />
    In addition, Huawei may collect information  regarding your age, gender, zip code, occupation, interests, purchase  preferences, language preferences, account IDs and passwords for the Sites, and  content you access, view, click  or search for  on the Sites, the device  from which you access such content and the length of time for which you view  same, information regarding the number of times you share content on the Sites  through social plugins such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube,  Pinterest, LinkedIn and Google+ as well as other information regarding your  sharing of such content, information regarding what you purchased or placed in  your shopping cart when on the Site, how you interact with content through the  Sites, Products or Services, information regarding what you access, input,  save, send and/or receive on or through the Products or Services, and other  information regarding the Sites, Products and Services and your use of same, as  further described below. In the event that such information is maintained in a  manner that identifies your name or contact information, it will be treated as  personally identifiable information; otherwise, such information will be  treated as non-personally identifiable information. Huawei may combine  personally identifiable information collected through the Sites, Products and  Services and with information available from other sources (such as offline  records or publicly available information). We will treat the combined  information as personally identifiable information. </p>
  <p><strong>3. How is Your Information Collected </strong></p>
  <p><strong>•  Personally Identifiable Information That You Give Us or That  is Generated by Your Actions </strong></p>
  <p>When you make use of the Sites, Products  and Services we collect certain personally identifiable information about you.  For example, you may choose to provide us with personally identifiable  information when you create an account or profile on the Sites or on your  Product or Service, purchase Products or Services, register or return your  Products or Services, have your purchases fulfilled, have your Products or  Services delivered, conduct Product or Service activation or verification, make  changes to or use your Huawei account, request and receive technical support or  authorised updates, communicate or interact with customer service or other  Huawei personnel, participate in an Activity, or when you provide other  information to us through the Sites or otherwise. This information may include  your delivery or billing address, user ID, password, order number, telephone  number, your payment details when ordering from the Sites, your email-address,  gender, date of birth, certain personal preferences, and other personally  identifiable information described in Section 2 above. Similarly, you may have  the option to back up your Product to a cloud Service offered by Huawei, and  doing so may result in the sharing of certain personally identifiable  information with Huawei. <br />
    Actions that you take such as making a  purchase on the Sites, returning a Product or Service, or requesting technical  support, may automatically create certain personally identifiable information  that we collect, such as transaction and order history, order numbers, return  history, and ticket numbers. The Sites may provide you with an option to log  in to the Sites using your profile information from a social network that you  are registered with. By using such a method to log in, Huawei may collect your  username, email and/or any other information associated with your account on  such social network that we request and you choose to share with us. </p>
  <p><strong>•  Information Collected through Technology </strong></p>
  <p>Your personally identifiable information  and non-personally identifiable information may be collected through a wide  range of technologies, many of which are detailed below. In the event that such  information is maintained in a manner that identifies your name or contact  information or is combined with personally identifiable information, it will be  treated as personally identifiable information; otherwise, such information  will be treated as non-personally identifiable information. </p>
  <p><strong>o Cookies and Other Identifiers </strong></p>
  <p>Huawei and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to collect information when you visit our Sites ("Collection Technology"). When you visit the Sites, your web browser may store cookies on your computer or device, or your computer or device may be exposed to other Collection Technology that works independently or in conjunction with cookies. Our cookies and other Collection Technology will enable the Sites to "remember" you, either during your single visit (using a "session cookie") or for repeated visits (using a "persistent cookie"), and may be used to analyse the way you interact with our Sites in order to optimise our services, to improve your experience and to provide you with personalised advertisements. Cookies may help the Sites remember your settings, such as font size, and other preferences for how you want to view the Sites on your computer or mobile device. Further, some of the interactive features of the Sites also rely on Collection Technology placed by third parties. The following are examples of the types of cookies that we use and for what purpose:</p>

If you submit personal information to any of those social networks, your information is governed by their privacy policies.  We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any social plug-in you use or third party website you visit. </li>

Should  the Policy be revised, Huawei will post the changes on the Sites and the new  Policy will be effective immediately upon posting. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the email address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this website prior to the change becoming effective.
